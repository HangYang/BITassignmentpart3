                When the project started, we had a meeting to discuss in order to choose a topic that everyone liked.
                We chose ‘game discount website, because our team members all like to play games and want to try to build a website to provide users with discounts.
                After this, we began to plan the project process, determined the project goals, and determined the special features of our website to provide discounts to users and then eventually the aim of the project.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                We spent more time in the planning stage than we expected, because each of our members provided different solutions and we were busy choosing the right solution.
                The biggest challenge is that we have never done such a project. Our technology is immature and our experience is not enough.
                We don't know how to complete the specific functions of our website. We must start from the most basic. Finally, we discussed and considered, so we made a task list.
                The task list includes the prototype and expanded functions of our project. Our group hopes it can be completed within the stipulated time.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                The main special feature of our website is that users can play games to get discounts, but this is the first time we want to play games on the web.
                After searching information on the Internet, we spent a lot of time completing ‘Tetris’, and then we found that the program code &lt;canvas&gt; &lt;/canvas&gt; conflicted.
                We need to change the game, and finally through the online development forum, we decided to use the snake game, and successfully completed it.
                This took us a lot of energy and time, and increased the burden of subsequent tasks.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                When the problem of the game is solved, the difficulty that follows is how to store the customer's score.
                We plan to build a database to store user scores, but because we have never done this feature before, we don't know how to do it, and there is not enough time left, only one week left.
                We decided to use website cache to temporarily store the score, and we wrote Json to handle this problem.
                Because there is no database, our generated discount code cannot be stored for a long time, so that the shopping cart cannot recognize the discount code.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                Another challenge is the control of time and energy. We spent a lot of time completing the contact us and about us pages.
                The search as an extended function was not completed. First, we have set too many goals, and second, we don’t have enough time and knowledge.
                So some functions could not be completed.
            </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>
                The summary is our lack of experience, knowledge and assessment of our own abilities.
                It took us a lot of time to solve the above problems, so that we did not have time to complete the originally planned project.
                However, we have learned a lot of things that we did not know before, and we have learned valuable knowledge and experience, which is very important for our growth.
