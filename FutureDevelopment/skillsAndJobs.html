                       Operations are critical to a product/project. So, what is the operation? Operation is different from sales. The operation can be regarded as "matchmaker". Matchmakers have information resources for men and women, so as long as they are introduced, people with mutual needs can reach a consensus. Generally speaking, the operation is to connect the needs of each other. There are many kinds of operation posts. We need new media operation posts here. In other words, companies or individuals use the new media platform to output content, and then precipitate fans to obtain traffic, so as to achieve the purpose of brand communication (popularity, recognition, loyalty, reputation) or sales transformation. For our products (websites), we need traffic, need Geng Duo people to know and browse, and even consume on our website, which is sustainable development. The operation can be said to be a crucial position.
                       For example, as far as the creativity of copywriting is concerned, how to make readers think of the second sentence after reading the first sentence, for example, can we combine some topics with traffic to attract users?
