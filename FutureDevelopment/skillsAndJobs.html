                    <li>A web designer is like a facade. From personal home pages to large companies, government departments and international organizations, all of them use web pages as their front page. When you click to the website, the first thing that comes into view is the interface design of the webpage, such as the introduction of the content, the placement of buttons, the combination of words, the application of colour, the guidance of use, etc. All of these are the domain of web design and the work of web designers. Web designers not only need to understand the design of the page, planning, typesetting, HTML code, flash animation but also understand some more code, which must be an all-round talent.

                        <li>Operations are critical to a product/project. So, what is the operation? Operation is different from sales. The operation can be regarded as "matchmaker". Matchmakers have information resources for men and women, so as long as they are introduced, people with mutual needs can reach a consensus. Generally speaking, the operation is to connect the needs of each other. There are many kinds of operation posts. We need new media operation posts here. In other words, companies or individuals use the new media platform to output content, and then precipitate fans to obtain traffic, so as to achieve the purpose of brand communication (popularity, recognition, loyalty, reputation) or sales transformation. For our products (websites), we need traffic, need Geng Duo people to know and browse, and even consume on our website, which is sustainable development. The operation can be said to be a crucial position.
                            This position requires members to master the use of PPT, PS and other software, and to have good operational thinking, will understand the user psychology and so on. For example, as far as the creativity of copywriting is concerned, how to make readers think of the second sentence after reading the first sentence, for example, can we combine some topics with traffic to attract users?
