            <td>We want to create a shopping website with a high-quality experience for shoppers to make 
			sure that they feel happy while shopping online. The "HD GAMES" shopping website provides the 
			latest game products and information, so that game lovers can learn about it for the first time,it 
			helps them save time. And the coupon code on the website helps them save money. Unlike other websites 
			or stores,our source of the coupon code will be very interesting. When shoppers play online games, the 
			final score will be displayed on the ranking list. The coupon code will be based on the score of the ranking 
			list to ensure that they can get the discount on the product while experiencing it. Then they can easily
			purchase the goods they want through the organized layout of the website. The blog function allows them to 
			communicate with each other, leave comments, and enhance the user experience. The game is originally an 
			interesting thing, so we ensured that this game website fits this nature. This website is open to all 
			Internet users.</td>

                    <li>Account Management</li>
                    <p>This goal is to allow users to register an account or log in. When they click the checkout 
					button on the store page, if they are not logged in, the page will automatically jump to the 
					login account interface, which ensures the consistency of shopping. In the registration 
					interface, all the fields must be filled in, the mobile phone number must be in the right formal 
					and password must be at least 6 digits to ensure security. Users can easily log in or log out on 
					each page.
                    </p>
                    <li>Online Game</li>
                    <p>Customers can get corresponding coupon codes by playing online games. The guidance and rule of the 
					online game will be displayed on the game page in an orderly manner. This page also contains music to 
					make users feel comfortable. Getting discount codes by playing online games is the best of both worlds, 
					allowing users to relax and have a certain opportunity to save money.
                    </p>
                    <li>Blog</li>
                    <p>This goal is to let users see the uploaded blogs and comments without logging in. When users log in, 
					they can create a new blog or leave a comment under a created blog. This ensures that users can communicate 
					with each other and share funny ideas.When they post a comment, the comment will be displayed below the 
					corresponding blog.It enhances the user experience.
                    </p>
                    <li>Checkout</li>
                    <p>Not all products in the store have coupon code applied.So when the customer is on the checkout page, 
					the corresponding product will have a corresponding payment interface(is there a coupon code input box?) 
					Other customer information and payment methods will have the correct format in each column for them to read 
					and fill in the information in the correct format. Each type of information will have a corresponding inputbox, 
					some icons are easy for customers to recognize,so that they will feel very organized when paying.
                    </p>
                    <li>Ranking List</li>
                    <p>The scores of playing online games will be displayed on the ranking list, and the ranking list is on 
					the left side of the game box. Users can know their scores and rankings the first time, but each user has only 
					one chance, so they will play very seriously to get high scores, which makes users feel very engaged and ensures 
					that they are actively happy while shopping.
                    </p>
                    <li>Display Goods</li>
                    <p>In the store, we have classified the games into three interfaces, including PC,Xbox and PlayStation4.In 
					this way, users can find the corresponding category in time when selecting the good, it really saves time. 
					The name and picture of each good are arranged on the page in an orderly manner.The checkout button is mint 
					green, and the layout of the entire product page will make customers feel comfortable.
                    </p>
