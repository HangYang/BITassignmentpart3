                As game lovers, we prefer to enjoy the game at home, want to know or buy the latest game,
                and also want to buy some game products at a discount. With the increasing popularity of online shopping and
                the COVID-19, it is a little difficult for them to go shopping in the store.So that we decide to develop a
                project to solve these problems. Our project is a shopping website called HD games. Users can register and
                login to view and purchase a series of new games. The most attractive place is the discount code. Game lovers
                can play small games on the website and get the corresponding coupon code according to the game ranking list.
                This is very interesting for game lovers. While enjoying the happiness of small games, they may get a certain
                discount on the purchase of goods. In addition, the blog function ensures the communication and sharing between
                users and enhances the user's sense of experience. Our project solves many problems such as users can't get the
                latest game, users can't go outside to shop, users can't get discounts, users don't feel relaxed when shopping
                and users don't have a sense of participation.In summary,our website brings them the best experience and value.
