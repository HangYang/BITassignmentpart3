This is my second year of learning information technology. I have some experience in java , database design and web development. These are the basics and I still need to learn more about information technology. One of my most interesting aspects is web development. This requires familiarity with HTML and PHP. In this project, I learned more about PHP language and how to use JSON to save data. On the other hand, I believe that the feedback from teachers, as well as team work and team communication are also very important.

I was involved in the project design, project plan and Assignment part 1, part 2, part 3. I am mainly responsible for the login and register features in this project. I wrote the registration, login and logout functions, and I use JSON to save the user account. I also determine whether users need to login first according to the content of each page. For example, guests can play online games, browse the product in the store, view news pages and blog. If they want to check out, create a new blog or use blog comments, they must login first. In addition, I wrote the framework of the website including head, navigation bar, footer and news page. I design a logo in head of our website. I also complete the contact page and about us page which is the extent of features.

In this subject I learned how to cooperate in a team. But I need to improve my knowledge of the database.

                My interest is to design and write web pages, which make me feel happy and successful. So for this project, I mainly wrote a web page to show different kinds of games and their prices. This requires a lot of advanced HTML and CSS to complete, such as grid layout. But in this project, I have a better command of HTML and CSS. I have learned some user interface design skills in previous courses, so I also have certain design abilities. I think my time management skills are also very strong. I will finish all the work within the specified time or even before, and guarantee the quality of the work. There will be no procrastination, no completion.
