                My interest is to design and write web pages, which make me feel happy and successful. So for this project, I mainly wrote a web page to show different kinds of games and their prices. This requires a lot of advanced HTML and CSS to complete, such as grid layout. But in this project, I have a better command of HTML and CSS. I have learned some user interface design skills in previous courses, so I also have certain design abilities. I think my time management skills are also very strong. I will finish all the work within the specified time or even before, and guarantee the quality of the work. There will be no procrastination, no completion.

                My interest is in designing and coding. So for this project, I am interested in developing the online game itself, which is the most important and challenging part of our project.
                I choose coding the game because I have had experience in design and implementing small games before.
                Besides programming, I also have designing skills which I am passionate about.
