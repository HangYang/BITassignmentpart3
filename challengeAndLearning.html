        <ul>
            <li>What we found easy</li>
            <p><b>Hang Yang: </b> The designing part was pretty straight forward as we had understood what should be designed and added MVFs on each web page.
               And the Design platform was easy to work with and each page was quick and easy to build.
            </p>
	    <p><b>Xin Lin: </b> In the whole project, for me, the simplest part should be the documentation part, such as design, elaborating the plan and so on.
            </p>
            <li>What we found difficult</li>
		    <p><b>Wenlao Peng:</b> It is difficult for me to  understand the Json files working. I spent a lot of time and energy studying this technology.
			I should buy a new laptop, my laptop is out of  date, the running speed is too low so that I am always busy.</p>
            <p><b>Yuxiang Huang: </b>At the beginning of the project, we faced a challenge. We need to decide what the project 
			is, so we chose three options. Due to lack of experience, we could not determine the content of the project 
			at first. Later when we chose to make this game website, we spent some time thinking about its characteristics, 
			and it should have different characteristics from the existing game websites on the market, and it should be 
			unique.</p>
		<p><b>Xin Lin: </b>On the contrary, the most challenging part of the whole project is to let me write the login part, which is integrated into every page of the whole website. By writing code to express which page needs login before it can be accessed. I have done a lot of research and study on this.</p>
            <li>What we expected</li>
            <p><b>Yuxiang Huang: </b>We expect that the design of the entire website should be easy at the beginning of the project, 
			but in the back-end development, we should face various problems. Because we have not fully learned all the 
			required knowledge, we expected to conduct research and development in the later stage, search for information 
			on the Internet to solve these problems.</p>
            <p><b>Hang Yang:</b> I expect that this teamwork will be difficult, especially when our members do not know each other at the early stage of forming up the group, and each member has other assignments to complete.
                When everything is stacked together, it is very difficult to gather together for meetings or discuss issues, especially when there is a time difference between us too.</p>
            <p><b>Xin Lin: </b>Initially I'm looking forward to our team can be built on a very professional senior website, can attract the attention of visitors and won a lot of attention, but the actual operation, is more difficult than the imagination of many, this requires a lot of technical support, we reserve knowledge, is not enough, they require a lot of research and study.</p>
		<li>What we did not expect</li>
            <p><b>Group:</b> One challenge is when we had decided the project idea after the very first meeting but got rejected by Dr. B twice for the idea when getting the approval for the project idea,
                which made our group feel overwhelmed at first and increased the time and resource constraint.</p>
            <li>New skills and experience that we have learned</li>
            <p><b>Baiwei Liu: </b>In our project we learn lots of new skills, such as using databases and JSON to store our data, 
            get comments by customers and save these data then appearing on our website. These new skills have never been learned before, 
            It is because of these challenges that we can sum up experience and learn and study more knowledge, which will be really helpful 
            and useful in our future work.</p>
		<p><b>Xin Lin: </b>In this project, What I learned the most is the application and development of PHP language, which is more convenient and intelligent than HTML. However, it is not easy to use and requires certain knowledge reserve. I learned a lot from the website and gained a lot by communicating with team members. Learn this language well, master this skill, for the future work will be of great help, also laid a certain foundation.</p>
            <li>Things have not worked out for us</li>
            <p>In this project, we have one feature not implemented which is an extension feature for search functions. Because this function needs a lot of data to support its implementation, we have no time to complete it in the end. On the other hand, although our website has the planned functions, we think that we still have more for improvement in page display and typesetting. Make our website more professional and user friendly.</p>
            <li>Plan changes / What we would have changed to the plan</li>
            <p>At the beginning of the project, we plan to use Tetris as an online game for the website. Later, because of the code conflict between the game and the logo of the website, it was unable to run when combined, so we changed the game to snake. We also made corresponding changes to the blog based on the tutor’s feedback.</p>
            <li>Was our timetable realistic</li>
            <p>We started with an estimate of the time required for the project, and everyone's time spent was different. In fact, some members of the team spent more time than estimated, while others estimated more time. Because this project was done by our team from scratch, and at the beginning, we only had a general framework. When it was really implemented, we would find many problems and fix many bugs. Or someone who starts to think it's difficult is actually doing it simply. On the whole, our estimates and schedules have some ups and downs.</p>
            <li>Have the tools and technologies worked out as expected</li>
            <p>The tools and technologies we use are going according to plan. In some technical aspects, we have done a lot of learning and research, and finally achieved the realization.</p>
