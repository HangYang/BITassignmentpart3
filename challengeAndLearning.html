        <ul>
            <li>What we found easy</li>
            <p><b>Hang Yang: </b> The designing part was pretty straight forward as we had understood what should be designed and added MVFs on each web page.
               And the Design platform was easy to work with and each page was quick and easy to build.
            </p>
            <li>What we found difficult</li>
            <p><b>Yuxiang Huang: </b>At the beginning of the project, we faced a challenge. We need to decide what the project 
			is, so we chose three options. Due to lack of experience, we could not determine the content of the project 
			at first. Later when we chose to make this game website, we spent some time thinking about its characteristics, 
			and it should have different characteristics from the existing game websites on the market, and it should be 
			unique.</p>
            <li>What we expected</li>
            <p><b>Yuxiang Huang: </b>We expect that the design of the entire website should be easy at the beginning of the project, 
			but in the back-end development, we should face various problems. Because we have not fully learned all the 
			required knowledge, we expected to conduct research and development in the later stage, search for information 
			on the Internet to solve these problems.</p>
            <li>What we did not expect</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>New skills and experience that we have learned</li>
            <p><b>Baiwei Liu: </b>In our project we learn lots of new skills, such as using databases and JSON to store our data, 
            get comments by customers and save these data then appearing on our website. These new skills have never been learned before, 
            It is because of these challenges that we can sum up experience and learn and study more knowledge, which will be really helpful 
            and useful in our future work.</p>
            <li>Things have not worked out for us</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Plan changes / What we would have changed to the plan</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Was our timetable realistic</li>
            <p></p>
            <li>Have the tools and technologies worked out as expected</li>
            <p></p>
